## About

ReadsReviews is a website developed using the Django Framework as the fourth project of my portfolio.

The main purpose of this website is for users to register an account so they can post reviews of books they have read, as well as discuss other users' reviews via comments.

The live website can be accessed here: [ReadsReviews](https://pp4-reads-reviews-6c28ac11e5b9.herokuapp.com/)

## User Experience Design

### Purpose and Target Audience

Developed for book lovers, the app is designed to be easy to use and intuitive. The main goal of the app is to help book lovers meet like-minded people and share their love of reading. This has been achieved by the use of a simple and intuitive interface.
