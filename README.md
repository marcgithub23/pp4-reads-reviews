## About

ReadsReviews is a website developed using the Django Framework as the fourth project of my portfolio.

The main purpose of this website is for users to register an account so they can post reviews of books they have read, as well as discuss other users' reviews via comments.

The live website can be accessed here: [ReadsReviews](https://pp4-reads-reviews-6c28ac11e5b9.herokuapp.com/)
